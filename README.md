# Introduction
As job hunting becomes increasingly difficult, I began to wonder if I could use data to help improve my chances, ultimately leading to this project. By analyzing historical layoff data, I aim to identify key factors leading to workforce reductions and help candidates make informed decisions.

# Questions

1. Which industry raised the most funds?
2. Which company raised the most funds?
3. Is there a correlation between the leading company and industry for funds raised?
4. Did this company have significantly higher or lower amount of layoffs?
5. What are the top five companies with most layoffs per year?

# Tools I Used

- **MySQL:**
- **Excel:**
- **Tableau:**
- **Visual Studio Code:** 
- **Git & GitHub:** 

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of why and where the layoffs were occuring. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. Which industry raised the most funds?
A much simpler query could be written to answer this question but I wanted to gain some additional insight to help me make correlations later on.

```sql
WITH top_5_per_year AS 
(
	WITH sum_for_industry_year AS (
		SELECT YEAR(date) AS year, Industry, ROUND(SUM(funds_raised_millions),0) AS sum_funds
		FROM layoffs_staging 
		WHERE funds_raised_millions IS NOT NULL AND YEAR(date) IS NOT NULL AND Industry IS NOT NULL
		GROUP BY YEAR(date), Industry
	)
	SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY year ORDER BY sum_funds DESC) AS row_num
	FROM (
		SELECT sum_for_industry_year.*, sum_funds_for_year, sum_funds/sum_funds_for_year*100 AS `sum_funds_%_of_total_for_year`, SUM(sum_funds) OVER() AS all_total, (sum_funds/SUM(sum_funds) OVER())*100 AS `sum_funds_%_of_all_years_total`
		FROM sum_for_industry_year 
		JOIN
			(SELECT YEAR(date) AS year, ROUND(SUM(funds_raised_millions),0) AS sum_funds_for_year
			FROM layoffs_staging
			WHERE funds_raised_millions IS NOT NULL AND YEAR(date) IS NOT NULL AND Industry IS NOT NULL 
			GROUP BY YEAR(date)) AS sub
		ON sub.year = sum_for_industry_year.year) AS sub2
	ORDER BY year DESC, sum_funds DESC
)
SELECT *
FROM top_5_per_year
WHERE row_num <= 5;
```
Output of query formated in excel:

Here's the breakdown:
- **Funds per Industry & Year:** In our first 2 columns, the top 5 industries leading in funds for each year are shown.
- **Funds per Year:** In the 3rd column the sum of funds for each undustry per year is shown. Then in the 4th column the sum of funds for the whole year is shown.
- **Job Title Variety:** The 5th column shows what percent of funds each industry makes up for each year.
- **gergdbsd:** Finally, the 6th column shows the total sum of all funds for everything. Then in the last column we see that media in 2022 alone makes up 31% of the whole total, clearly indicating that media is our winner.
  

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT	
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023:
